                        ### IPS (Internet Protocol Suite)

                        Conceptual model of the protocol structure allowing *the internet*.

                        Consists of 4 layers :
                        - **Application Layer** : Interfaces and communication protocoles, specific to the applications using the network. <span class="detail">(HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, SMTP, IMAP, Telnet, ...)</span>
                        - **Transport Layer** : Adds advanced communication features : connexions, reliability, flow control, etc. <span class="detail">(TCP, UDP, ...)</span>
                        - **Internet Layer** : Routs packets between hosts, identified by an IP address. <span class="detail">(IP, ICMP, IPsec, ...)</span>
                        - **Link Layer** : Communication on actual tangible media. <span class="detail">(ARP, PPP, MAC(Ethernet, Wifi, DSL, Fibre), ...)</span>

                        Hierarchical and decentralized implementation of a dictionary :

                        <div class="centered">

                          **Domain name ⟼ IP Address**

                        <img alt="Networking" src="images/network_dns.svg" style="width: 65%;" />

                        Uses TCP for zone transfer and UDP for name queries.

                        Notes:

                        The <b>Domain Name System (DNS)</b> is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system (phone book) for computers connected to the Internet. 
                        It translates domain names to IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computers.

                        A DNS request happens roughly as follows:
                        - Your computer makes a request to translate a domain name into an IP address that it will then be able to use to retrieve resources.
                        - That request goes to a DNS resolver, which will handle the conseptually "recursive" retrieval of the information.
                        - The DNS resolver essentially asks DNS servers for information recursively, starting from the most generic one to the most specific one, each giving information about where to find more specific information.
                        - The first server to be contacted is the root DNS server, which only knows about Top Level Domain (TLD) servers. Each TLD server is responsible for the top-level part of the domain name, i.e. `.com`, `.net` etc. The root server thus answers the resolver with information about where to find the TLD server that will know more about the requested address. If the requested address is `www.example.com`, it will thus redirect to the `.com` TLD.
                        - The resolver receives that message telling him who to ask next. It does so and receives another answer, again for who to ask next. It does that recursively until it reaches a Name Server knowing the IP address of the full requested domain name.
                        - The resolver sends that address to your computer, which can now use that address to send a request for resources on that server.

                        Note that each involved machine (Root, TLD, Name
                        servers, DNS resolver, even your computer) can cache
                        information. For instance, the resolver may remember
                        where to find a TLD server responsible for the `.com`
                        domain, and ask that one directly.

                        #### Replication

                        The servers listed above are rarely alone: for example,
                        there are multiple root servers, and multiple TLD
                        servers. Even name servers, at the bottom of the chain,
                        are often replicated in more than one, in order to
                        ensure redundancy and fault tolerance. DNS Zone Transfer
                        is what is used to ensure that these replication servers
                        all hold consistent data.

                        #### Domains and zones

                        The domain name realm is laminated into domains and sub-domains. Generally, each domain forms a **DNS zone**.

                        #### DNS zone files

                        Each zone has a file containing de list of the IP addresses associated to its domain names, within **Resource Records (RR)**.

                        ```bash
                        # DNS lookup
                        nslookup -type=any heig-vd.ch
                        dig heig-vd.ch

                        # Reverse DNS lookup
                        host 91.198.174.192

                        # Info on the domain owner
                        whois heig-vd.ch
                        ```

                        Notes:

                        - A Domain Name System (DNS) zone file is a text file that describes a DNS zone. 
                        - A DNS zone is a subset, often a single domain, of the hierarchical domain name structure of the DNS. 
                        - The zone file contains mappings between domain names and IP addresses and other resources, organized in the form of text representations of resource records (RR).

                        #### More about DNS

                        Mozilla provides a nice cartoon of how DNS works, what are its limitations in terms of security and privacy, and why DNS over HTTPS is needed.

                        ```

                        Notes:

                        Each line starting with a domain name corresponds to a Resource Record. It is formatted as follows:

                        ```
                        name record_class record_type record_data
                        ```

                        - `name`: the name of the (sub)domain corresponding to that RR. If it does not end with a `.`, it is a *relatively* qualified name, relative to the current origin. This explains the `www` record, which thus corresponds to `www.example.com`.
                        - `record_class`: indicates the namespace of the information. Usually, the namespace is that of the internet, denoted `IN`.
                        - `record_type`: the type of information in the record. For example, `A` and `AAAA` for *address record* (IPv4 and IPv6, respectively), `MX` for the mail host of the SMTP domain, or `CNAME` for declaring aliases.
                        - `record_data`: the data associated to the name, depending on the `record_type`. For example, an IPv4 address for type `A` records, or another domain name for `CNAME`.

                    ## <i class="fas fa-window-maximize"></i>  Mozilla's Definition

                    The World Wide Web - commonly referred to as WWW, W3, or the Web - is an interconnected system of public webpages accessible through the Internet. The Web is not the same as the Internet: the Web is one of many applications built on top of the Internet.

                    The system we know today as "the Web" consists of several components:
                    - The HTTP protocol governs data transfer between a server and a client.
                    - To access a Web component, a client supplies a unique universal identifier, called a URL (uniform resource location) or URI (uniform resource identifier).
                    - HTML (hypertext markup language) is the most common format for publishing web documents.

                    Tim Berners-Lee proposed the architecture of what became known as the World Wide Web. He created the first web server, web browser, and webpage at the CERN in 1990. 
                    In 1991, he announced his creation, marking the moment the Web was first made public.

                    Client-server protocol allowing the fetching of resources on the web.

                    A document is usually reconstructed from multiple sub-documents, fetched independently (e.g. text, style, images, videos, etc).

                    Notes:

                    HTTP is a protocol which allows the fetching of resources, such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. A complete document is reconstructed from the different sub-documents fetched, for instance text, layout description, images, videos, scripts, and more.

                        The Unix world is at the origin of many popular text protocols, such as FTP, POP3, SMTP or IMAP.

                        HTTP follows the same philosophy, which allows to easily observe what transits on the network. 

                        Use telnet to open a TCP connection and perform a simple get request.

                        HTTPS complicated the observability a bit!

                        But [CURL](https://curl.haxx.se/) takes care of it for you:

                        ```bash
                        curl -v https://httpstat.us/200?param=value
                        ```

                        Or have a look at the DevTools in Chrome (CTRL+SHIFT+I):
